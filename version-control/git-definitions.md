# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is like the entire timeline of a file that allows us to use files from various save points and to manage the revisions from different people on  a team. It is useful because it allows people to simultaneously work on projects and clearly lays out different edits for a file.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a separation from the main file. I would use one to work on something without affecting the original file. Branches are useful because it allows a separate version to edit on and allows users to only merge their files when they are satisfied with an edit. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A git commit will allow a user to save their file with any changes into a repository. A good commit message will clearly indicate what changes were made and be easy to refer to in the future. It should involve a summary of changes and then more detailed information if necessary. 

* What is a merge conflict?
Merge conflicts invove when there are issues with the branches merging into each other. This can occur when Git does not know which version it should incorporate. For example if two people have edited the same things in a file or if one person deleted the file. A merge conflict will have to be solved before continuing.
