# Answers to Questions

**1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?**
At the center of the Linux philosophy is a concept that we now call Open Source Software. While recently the number of new features and critical changes to the system has diminished, the general rule is that a new version of the kernel will be released about every few weeks (sometimes even more frequently than this). New features or software applications start off in the "alpha" phase, enter the "beta" state and then may go to a "final" stage.


**2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?**
VPS Hosting or virtual private server hostingtechnology is used to get multiple virtual servers from a single physicalserver. The method is by partitioning a physical server into multiple VirtualPrivate Servers (VPS). Each one VPS has resources and OS that is independentfrom the other virtual servers on the physical machine. Thus the overallperformance of one VPS never implicates with another VPS on the same physicalmachine.
1. More control compared to shared hosting, complete access to root environment
2. Green technology, environmentally friendly, and more efficient use of resources because more people can share the resources of a single physical server
3. Cost effective solutions for small websites
4. Easy scalability when needed
5. More stability and reliability for basic web hosting needs

**3. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?**
Its just good practice on any operating system to run your applications on a user level and leave administrative tasks to the root user, and only on a per-need basis. The security model is that root users can modify the underlying system and crashes can wipe out various directories.
